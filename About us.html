          <H2>ABOUT US</H2>
          <h4>Our story changed one morning in Dubai….</h4>
          <p>Back in April 2012, Mr. Ismail Jani asked us to bring the Dosa World. truck to his residential<br/>
             complex for some fresh dosa and vada… what we experienced in the next 3 hours completely<br/>
             changed the way we looked at the business for good.<br/>
            </p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>We were sold out in 2 hours of our parking the truck in the Alaknanda neighborhood and that<br/>
               started our “food on the go!” journey - taking our food to the customers rather than waiting for<br/>
               them to arrive.

                    <p>
                      As a 17 year old, Aliya Begum, planned a Dosa shop in the local market.
                       15 years later, she made it to her locality with a Dosa Truck. Such is the
                        nature of enterprise. She returned from the US after completing her BA, Knox
                         College and her Masters in HR and IR, UIUC to assist her father in his Logistics
                          & Supply Chain company. One of the most valuable lessons she learnt was about the
                           value of quality service. Dosa World is not just about the food, it is about giving a
                            complete product and service experience to the customer.
